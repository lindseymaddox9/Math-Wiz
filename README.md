# Math-Wiz 
Interactive MERN Stack Single-Page Application that allows children to practice multiplication flashcards.  They will practice times tables from 0 to 12 and become the ultimate Math Wizard!

## User story:
AS a person who wants to practice their multiplication tables
I WANT a multiplication flashcards website
SO THAT I can improve my math skills and quickly recall multiplication tables .
GIVEN a multiplication flashcards website
WHEN I visit the login page
THEN I am prompted to enter my login details.
WHEN I dont have an account
THEN I will be redirected to the sign up page.
WHEN I am logged in to my account
THEN I can view the homepage, which includes a flashcard with a randomly generated multiplication table practice question (multiple between 1-12), and a scorekeeper based on how many questions the user gets correct.
WHEN I get the answer correct
THEN I earn a point or move to the next question.
WHEN I get the answer wrong
THEN I am taken to the the next question

## Description

MERN-stack single-page application, you’ll combine a scalable MongoDB back end, a GraphQL API, and an Express.js and Node.js server with a React front end, implementing user authentication with JWT to build a user-focused platform. You’ll continue to build on the agile development methodologies you’ve used throughout this course. These include storing your project code in GitHub, managing your work with a project management tool, and implementing feature and bug fixes using the Git branch workflow and pull requests.
•	Used React for the front end.
•	Used GraphQL with a Node.js and Express.js server.
•	Used MongoDB and the Mongoose ODM for the database.
•	Used queries and mutations for retrieving, adding, updating, and deleting data.
•	Deployed using Render.
•	Responsive.
•	Interactive
•	Authentication (JWT).
•	Protected sensitive API key information on the server.


## Technologies & Resources Used: 

Visual Studio Code -This is the program used to write all the code for this challenge. Below are the links to the website and their license. https://code.visualstudio.com/ https://code.visualstudio.com/License/

Github- This program was used to upload my code so it is saved and others can view what I have done. Below are the links to the website and license. https://www.github.com https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-of-service

Xpert Learning Assistant- The Xpert Learning Assistant is a chat AI program created by the Full-Stack Web Development program to assist students, like myself, with any questions they may have.

UT Class Repository - We referred back to several of our class lessons to help us build our application.  

ChatGPT 3.5 -I used this AI to help further my understanding of back end coding. It helped with clarification from what Xpert Learning Assistant was giving me and I was still was not understanding. https://chat.openai.com/ https://openai.com/policies/terms-of-use

Node.js- is a free, open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that lets developers create servers, web apps, command line tools and scripts. https://nodejs.org/en

Express.js- Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js. https://www.npmjs.com/package/express License MIT

Mongoose - Mongoose is a MongoDB object modeling tool designed to work in an asynchronous environment. Mongoose supports Node.js and Deno (alpha). https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose License MIT

MongoDB-Take advantage of a simple and expressive query API to retrieve and modify documents in a single collection or join across collections. https://www.mongodb.com/

MidJourney- This is an art generator application.  The user types in prompts and it will generate four random images based on the information given.  These were used for images throughout our project. * All images were created by Samantha Shuttleworth (Roillena) using her Midjourney account.  https://www.midjourney.com/home https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/en/terms-of-service

React- React lets you build user interfaces out of individual pieces called components. Create your own React components like Thumbnail, LikeButton, and Video. Then combine them into entire screens, pages, and apps. https://react.dev/

GraphQl - GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data. GraphQL provides a complete and understandable description of the data in your API, gives clients the power to ask for exactly what they need and nothing more, makes it easier to evolve APIs over time, and enables powerful developer tools. https://graphql.org/

JWT - JSON Web Tokens are an open, industry standard RFC 7519 method for representing claims securely between two parties. https://jwt.io/

Render - Build, deploy, and scale your apps with unparalleled ease – from your first user to your billionth. https://render.com/

## Acknowledgements:
The three of us would like to acknowledge our instructor Rachel and teaching assistant Mark, for all the support we received from the two of them throughout this project. Both continued to answer any questions we had and with their guidance we were able to create a very fun web game.  We are also thankful to be able to use tools such as our class ai chat bot, Xpert learning assistant, as well as, our class lessons.  We were able to use both resources to help us build this application.  Outside resources like chatgpt and code documentation were also valuable in helping us with this project.  Finally, we would like to thank each other. The three of us worked phenominaly as a team and it was such a fun final project for our full stack bootcamp. We helped each other throughout the whole process and had so much fun designing and coding this game.
