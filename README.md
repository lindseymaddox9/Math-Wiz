Interactive MERN Stack Single-Page Application that allows children to practice multiplication flashcards 

Description

MERN-stack single-page application, you’ll combine a scalable MongoDB back end, a GraphQL API, and an Express.js and Node.js server with a React front end, implementing user authentication with JWT to build a user-focused platform. You’ll continue to build on the agile development methodologies you’ve used throughout this course. These include storing your project code in GitHub, managing your work with a project management tool, and implementing feature and bug fixes using the Git branch workflow and pull requests.
•	Used React for the front end.
•	Used GraphQL with a Node.js and Express.js server.
